# 👋 Hi, I'm **Tudor Neagu**

A full-stack web developer passionate about building digital solutions and web technologies.

## 🚀 **About Me**

🎓 After 7 years of experience as an architect, I made the decision to transition into full-stack web development through an intensive bootcamp at **O'Clock**.  
🔍 I am currently looking for a **job or internship starting in December** to apply my skills in real-world projects.  
🌱 I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my technical skills, with a focus on performance optimization and creating high-quality user experiences.

### 💼 **My Unique Background**

With over 7 years of experience in architecture, I developed strong skills in problem-solving, project management, and creating user-focused designs. Throughout my career, I’ve always been passionate about both architecture and technology. In fact, I had an ongoing interest in web development and programming, and over time, I realized that I could merge these two passions.

Transitioning into full-stack web development has allowed me to combine my creative architectural mindset with my technical skills. I leverage my experience in designing structures and managing complex projects to now build intuitive, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My architectural background gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving and planning, which I now apply to creating efficient, well-structured digital solutions.
